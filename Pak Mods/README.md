# F7 Menu  
As it stands right now, the mod requires a World Map item to exist somewhere in the world.  You don't have to keep it with you, but you have to own one.  Since you start out with one, this shouldn't be an issue.  
  
M for Map  
Shift + Z to duplicate item under crosshairs  
F7 for menu  
  
Menu functions:
 - Delete Items (Checkboxes to delete groups of items from the world)
 - Tidy World (Teleports all items to the back of nearest truck) (Temporarily disabled)
 - Set and freeze time of day
 - Set characters acceleration and max speed
 - Free Cam
 - Collision toggle - **Only use when flying!  Be sure you turn collisions back on before turning flight off!**
 - Flight Mode (Shift up, Ctrl down, Z to brake)
 - Teleport via coordinates
